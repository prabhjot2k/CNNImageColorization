# CNNImageColorization
Image Colorization using a CNN Model with an InceptionResNetv2 Classifier

Inspired by and Followed the work of https://richzhang.github.io/colorization/ & https://github.com/emilwallner/Coloring-greyscale-images

# To Run
Download the weights of the InceptionResNetv2 Model - "inception_resnet_v2_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels"
